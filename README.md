# Makers & Managers Toolkit

This repository provides a **cross-platform toolkit** for onboarding both **Makers** (developers) and **Managers** in our company, **Applicita**. These setup guides and automation scripts are used internally to streamline workspace setup across **Ubuntu** and **Windows** environments. We have decided to open-source these tools to share them with others who may find them useful for their own teams.
